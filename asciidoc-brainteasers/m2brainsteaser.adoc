== Overview

The first part of learning Kafka fundamentals is understanding what Kafka is good at and exploring use cases. Key concepts are:

* Real time vs. batch processing
* Use cases


Hereâ€™s the https://forms.gle/ww7MZ74BmLsYrc1R6[quick quiz on Module 2] from the Online Talk Series.

*Note:* For this form of these brain teasers, I've opted to number the problems so that they correspond with module numbers from the Fundamentals course. Thus, we start with Problem #2, corresponding to Module 2; there is no #1.

== Problem #2A: Applying Kafka to a Digital Jukebox Use Case

Suppose you are building a network of digital jukeboxes that operate in restaurants, bars, event spaces, etc. Users can maintain accounts and use credit cards and a phone app to purchase credits to play songs. Using the same app, users can play songs, as long as they are located within a reasonable distance of a jukebox they are targeting.
So, thinking of some of the things Kafka is cut out for, what are at least 3 reasons Kafka is well-suited for this application? (Hint: Review the Module 2: Motivation & Customer Use Cases lecture and/or the handbook.)
