== Overview

Key concepts from Module 4 are:

* A simple producer code example in the Java API
* A simple consumer code example in the Java API
* Replication, leaders, and followers
* Deletion retention policy
* Producer design
* Acknowledgments
* Idempotence
* Partitioning strategies
* Consumer groups and rebalancing
* Security 


Hereâ€™s the https://forms.gle/JyY2w9FN6iCTsp5y7[quick quiz on Module 4] from the Online Talk Series.

== Problem #4A: Relating Consumers in Groups

Suppose you have a topic with 3 partitions, _p_~0~, _p_~1~, and _p_~2~. Further, suppose we have consumer group _g_~0~ with consumers _c_~0~ and _c_~1~. No matter what further configuration you have, what is the same about _c_~0~ and _c_~1~? What is different?

== Problem #4B: Fixing a Broken Consumer/Partition Assignment

Suppose you have a topic with 3 partitions, _p_~0~, _p_~1~, and _p_~2~. Further, suppose you have consumer group _g_~0~ with consumers _c_~0~ and _c_~1~. Suppose at one point in time, we have only the following assignments: _c_~1~ is consuming from _p_~0~ and _c_~1~ is consuming from _p_~2~. What is the downside about this situation? Propose a fix.

== Problem #4C: Understanding Consumer Offsets

Suppose you have a topic with 3 partitions, _p_~0~, _p_~1~, and _p_~2~. Further, suppose you have consumer group _g_~0~ with consumers _c_~0~ and _c_~1~. It's the same situation as before. Suppose _c_~1~ just read the message at offset 12 in _p_~0~. What is its consumer offset for this partition? With your fix in mind, are there any other consumer offsets stored?

== Problem #4D: When Can Two Consumers Consume the Same Partition? 

Suppose you have a topic with 3 partitions, _p_~0~, _p_~1~, and _p_~2~. Further, suppose you have consumer group _g_~0~ with consumers _c_~0~ and _c_~1~. You know that _c_~1~ is consuming from _p_~0~. Can _c_~0~ consume from _p_~0~? If so, why? If not, how can you change the setup to allow another consumer to consume from _p_~0~?
