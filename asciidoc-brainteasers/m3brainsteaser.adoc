== Problem #3A: How Do Producers Connect to Consumers?

Suppose you have a Kafka cluster; one producer, _p_~0~, producing to topic _t_~0~, with one partition; and one consumer _c_~0~, reading from topic _t_~0~. _c_~0~ read what _p_~0~ produced. This implies _p_~0~ and _c_~0~ are related. What is the nature of this relationship? If you add another producer _p_~1~ (that also produces to topic _t_~0~), must you also add another consumer (e.g., _c_~1~) to read messages from _p_~1~?

== Problem #3B: Single Consumption or Multiple Consumption?

Suppose you have a Kafka cluster; one producer, _p_~0~, producing to topic _t_~0~, with one partition; and one consumer _c_~0~, reading from topic _t_~0~. Independent of the last question, suppose consumer _c_~0~ read message _m_~0~. Could another consumer _c_~10~, in another consumer group, also consume message _m_~0~?
